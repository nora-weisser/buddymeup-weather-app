# buddymeup-weather-app

## Overview

This project contains an application developed during the WWCode Python BuddyMeUp program. The initial concept is to develop a Django weather application and then integrate that application into a transit-related application, so that users can see the weather at various locations, plan trips, and have up-to-date weather info at those locations.

This concept is likely to evolve as the project develops.

## Goals

The main goals of this project are to learn Python! Specifically, this project will help the contributors gain experience: 
* Writing Python and Django
* Working with Git
* Working with other developers
